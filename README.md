### Task

The task is to write a function that finds pairs of integers from a list that
sum to a given value. The function will take as input the list of numbers as
well as the target sum.

### Use

### Case 1

Put in the command line:
** python findForPairs.py **

_Read a txt file which is separated by commas, convert it to an array and compare all the numbers in the array_

### Case 2

Put in the command line:
** python findForPairs2.py **

_The same file as the first one, only without the txt which makes it faster_

### Method

Both use the bubble method to generate the result

### Note:

_There are other methods to generate this type of results, in this case use the most convenient and it seemed the fastest_

For the txt, put a comma at the end for the function already described, it reads all those that have a comma, this can be solved, but it would cost more lines of code, which means more load and less efficiency for the script
